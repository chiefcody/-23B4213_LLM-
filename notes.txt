                              What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed

In other words, It’s a field of study that gives computers the ability to think without being explicitly programmed


There are precisely 4 types of Machine Learning Algorithms 
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning 
Recommender Systems
Reinforcement Learning


                                  Supervised Learning 

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a computer program learns by analysing data which has already been labelled.
Imagine that you're training a puppy – you show it a ball (labelled data) and say "fetch" (the label). The more you do this, the better the puppy gets at recognizing a ball and fetching it.
Here's how it works in machine learning:
Labelled data: The data used to train the model has two parts: features (inputs) and labels (outputs).


Features describe the data, like pixels in an image or words in a sentence.
Labels tell the model what the data represents, like "cat" or "dog" for an image.
Learning process: The model analyses the features and labels in the training data to identify patterns. It's just like the puppy learning to recognize the ball based on its shape and colour.
Predictions: Once trained, the model can use its learned patterns to make predictions on new, unseen data. It can, for example, identify a new image as a cat based on what it learned from the training data.

                  Input           	         	     output label
  
Learns from being given right labels

Input 			                             	Output		                      	Application

Email             --------->          Spam (0/1)			                    Spam Filtering
Audio             --------->          Text transcription	               	Speech Recognition
English           --------->         	Spanish		                         	Machine Translation
User info         --------->          Click (0/1)		                    	Online advertising
Sensor            --------->          Position of Car	                  	Self Driving Cars


                                      Regression

Regression analysis is a statistical technique used to understand the relationship between one variable (dependent variable) and one or more other variables (independent variables).

                                  Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning, unlike supervised learning, deals with unlabeled data. Imagine you're presented with a box of toys – you don't know what they are (no labels), but you want to organise them somehow. Unsupervised learning helps you find patterns and structure within this

Clustering:
 This is like grouping the toys – the algorithm finds groups (clusters) of data points that share similar characteristics.


Dimensionality Reduction: Imagine the toys have many features (colour, size, weight, etc.). Dimensionality reduction simplifies the data by finding a lower-dimensional representation that captures the most important information. It's like summarising the key features of each toy set.


Association Rule Learning: In this task it finds the relationship between data. For example, it might identify that red cars are often found with blue blocks (like finding toys that frequently appear together).

                                  Deep Learning

Deep learning is a type of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain
It aims to train computers to process information with a similar level of complexity and accuracy as the human brain

Deep learning models learn by processing large amounts of data. As they process the data, they adjust the connections between the nodes in the network, allowing them to identify patterns and make predictions.
Deep learning is a powerful tool that has revolutionized many fields. It's used in various applications like:

1)Self-driving cars
2)Facial recognition systems
3)Medical diagnosis
4)Machine translation
5)Voice assistants
